# Deep-learning
# LAB01 - Handcraft CNN model & Rebuild with Pytorch
This folder contains two main tasks:
1. Handcraft CNN model
2. Pytorch building CNN

## Dataset

You can down load the dataset from Google drive:
👉 [Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13b2rJiCCMwjw_0Fz3k6E2ZBINVW9f8cJ?usp=share_link)

After dowloading, you should put these within folder named 'data'

### For Task 1:
You will have to use the Jupyter notebook 'Lab01_task1_111261022.ipynb' as main code.
And then import the 'layer.py' and 'network.py' in the folder named 'model'


# LAB02 - Pedestrian Counting with CDenseNet

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of our model.

## Dataset
The dataset is too large to upload to GitHub.  
You can download it from Google Drive:
